# Resume_API

I want to create an API endpoint part for resume. It will handle who is loged in, create resume,
update it, delete it and also show whole resume or just part what we want to see. Whole information
will be in DB (in my situation I will use MySQL).

## 🗂️ Part of resume
- Personal information
- Education
- Work experience
- About you
- Skills
- "if something come to my mind I will add it here"

## 🔬 Optional way how app will be created
1. Create Object of User
2. Implement JWT Token and create endpoint for Login.
3. Create basic endpoints for create, update, delete, get complete resume or get part of it.
4. Create connection with DB
5. Create Object of Resume
6. Make a relationship between User and Resume object
7. Create Services.
8. "If everything will work like we want, we can start work on frontend part"

## 🚀 Technology what I want to use
- Spring framework
- JWT Token
- Java 21
- MySQL
- "Frontend maybe JS"

If anybody want to see something or want to add in project, please contact me.
